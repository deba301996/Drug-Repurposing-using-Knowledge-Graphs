# Drug-Repurposing-using-Knowledge-Graphs
This project is aimed at exploring the utilisation of Knowledge graph embedding models in the field of drug repurposing for the treatment of NSCLC (Non-small Cell Lung Cancer). These models can reveal hidden associations and discover novel drug candidates that hold promise for treating NSCLC by utilising existing knowledge graphs which contain gene-drug-disease relationships.

The methodology employed is shown below:

The model training process is described below:

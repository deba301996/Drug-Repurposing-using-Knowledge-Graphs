# Drug Repurposing using Knowledge Graphs
This project is aimed at exploring the utilisation of Knowledge graph embedding models in the field of drug repurposing for the treatment of NSCLC (Non-small Cell Lung Cancer). These models can reveal hidden associations and discover novel drug candidates that hold promise for treating NSCLC by utilising existing knowledge graphs which contain gene-drug-disease relationships.

The technology stack employed included Python (Dask, Ampligraph), Perl, Neo4j. The models were trained on High Performance Computing (HPC) resources.

The methodology employed is shown below:
